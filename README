MATASANO CRYPTO CHALLENGES

These are my (Carl Winbäck’s) solutions to the Matasano Crypto Challenges.

My solutions are written in Python 3.

ATTENTION: Before you look at this code I urge you to first try solving the
challenges yourself. They are very fun and you’ll learn more that way.

More info about the challenges can be found at the official web site:

DEPENDENCIES
The unit tests need pytest [http://pytest.org/]. Otherwise I don’t think there
are any external dependencies.
